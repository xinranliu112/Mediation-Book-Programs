# Mediation-Book-Programs

The computer syntax and output files on this CD have been included to help the reader apply the analyses in the book to their own research. Whenever possible, computer syntax and output have been given for multiple statistical packages to enable the reader to use their statistical program of choice. The five statistical programs included on this CD are SPSS (version 29.0.0), SAS (version 9.4), EQS (version 6.03), LISREL (version 8.80), MPLUS (version 8.11), and R (version 4.4.3). Although many of the syntax files should work regardless of the version of the software that the reader is using, it is possible that the provided syntax files will not work in all versions of the different packages. It should also be noted that different programs will give slightly different results which are a result of difference in the estimation procedures between program and the number of decimal points the program uses. In all cases, the differences between results should be negligible.

The syntax and output sfiles contained on this CD all follow a common naming convention. First, the chapter number in which the example appears in the book is given followed by an underscore. Second, a brief description of the example is given followed by an underscore. Finally, the name of the statistical package used is given.  In addition, the three-letter file extension can be used to identify the files. SAS syntax files have a ‘.sas’ extension and SAS output files have a ‘.lst’ extension. SPSS syntax files have a ‘.sps’ extension and SPSS output files have a ‘.spv’ extension. EQS syntax files have a ‘.eqs’ extension and EQS output files have a ‘.out’ extension. LISREL syntax files have a ‘.ls8’ extension and LISREL output files have a ‘.out’ extension. MPLUS syntax files have a ‘.inp’ extension and MPLUS output files have a ‘.out’ extension. R syntax files have s ‘.R’ extension and R output files have a ‘.txt’ extension.
